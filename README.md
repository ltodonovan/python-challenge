# python-challenge
for this I recieved help from TAs to fix my code
So this is what I changed:
I messed around by going backwards with what was initially wrong.
I first changed the float to int
• for total_change
• for previous_revenue
I removed the square brackets from total_change for the IF statements
then I swapped out revenue_change underneath those two if statements with total_change
